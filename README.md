# CSC223

## Overview

This project repo contains my classwork for the
Data Structures and Analysis of Algorithms (CSC 223) class that 
I am taking for my associates degree in computer science at NOVA. 

## Support

Huge thanks to Mr. Elkner (my professor) for 
providing me with the skills and resources to be able to program. 
Although I am a highschool student am I still able to complete college-level
courses at [Arlington Tech](https://careercenter.apsva.us/arlington-tech/).
